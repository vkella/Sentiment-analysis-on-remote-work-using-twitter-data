Inspiration

To prevent the spread of the virus during Covid, many people were required to work from home. For the majority of the population, working from home is a relatively new experience, and there were numerous challenges. The data from Twitter was used to determine how people reacted to the new change.
What it does

Based on tweets containing work from home/ remote work/ virtual work text, the model determines whether the user's sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
